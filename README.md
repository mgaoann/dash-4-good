# Dash 4 Good
A community-powered platform connecting organizations with food banks through volunteer delivery.

Dash 4 Good helps reduce food waste and fight hunger by connecting organizations with surplus food to nearby food banks through community volunteers. Restaurants and grocery stores can post pickup and delivery requests, while volunteers can claim and complete deliveries--making food rescue fast, efficient, and collaborative.

## Features
- Post pickup & delivery requests
- Claim delivery tasks as a volunteer
- Real-time navigation with Google Maps API
- Push notifications powered by Firebase

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend & Database:** Firebase
- **Maps & Geolocation:** Google Maps API
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging

## MVP Focus
Our hackathon focus was to design and build a functional frontend MVP that demonstrates how technology can empower communities to combat hunger and reduce waste.

### MVP Features
- Organizations: Post pickup/delivery requests (food type, quantity, pickup address)
- Volunteers: View nearby requests, claim delivery, mark as completed
- Authentication: Signup/Login for both roles
- Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging for new requests and updates
- Map integration: Show pickup → dropoff route
